# What is rust?
Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. <br/>
It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection. <br/>
In current IT sphere, you have safety or more control. <br/>
Rust has both, safety and control in the same place. <br/>

---

# Why rust is so amazing?
* First of all - **Amazing** Community.
* Extremely open development process.
* The community can be part of decisions in [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
* Supports functional and imperative-procedural paradigms.
* Gives you safety.
* More close to the bare metal.
* Does not have garbage collector.
* Have very small runtime.
* LLVM backend and optimizations.
* Statically typed.
* Move semantics.
* Zero cost abstractions.
* No segfaults.
* No dangling pointers.
* No null pointers.
* No iterator invalidation problems.
* No data races.
* Is used to develop [servo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_(layout_engine)) browser.
* Rust won first place for "most loved programming language" in the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2016 and 2017.](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)
* Benchmarks at [Benchmarksgame](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=rust&lang2=gpp)
* [Who uses rust.](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/friends.html)

---

# Simple Installation
Go to [https://www.rustup.rs](https://www.rustup.rs) <br/>
which suggests to copy and paste `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh` to your terminal.

---

# The rustup toolchain
The rustup brings
* The rust programming language itself such as standard library etc...
* `rustc` - The rust-lang compiler.
* `rustup` - The CLI tool which helps to change language distribution channels like `stable`, `beta`, `nightly` and not only.
* `rustdoc` - The rust documentation generator.
* `rust-gdb` and `rust-lldb` debuggers.
* `cargo` - The [cargo](https://crates.io/) package manager.
* Testing tools and such.

---

# Cargo package manager
[crates.io](https://crates.io/) the Rust community’s crate host. <br/>
* Unified tool and central repository for entire rust community.
* Easy to use and very intuitive CLI commands.
* Build, execute, test, benchmark and publish bin or lib projects.

# The publishing crates is really simple.
1. login to crates.io using your access token from dashboard.
```bash
cargo login abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
```
2. Package your lib/bin distribution.
```bash
cargo package

# Documentation
The rust documentation is really differs from your know language documentations
* Markdown support.
* Compile time checks.
* Unified host for all open source libs documentations.
* Examples are everywhere.
* to be continued...

---

# Language semantics
* Ownership.
* Borrowing.
* Life times.

---

# Ownership
There is only one owner of the data at the same time.
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User(u32);

fn main() {
    let user = User(46); // the owner is main function
    consume_user(user); // user moved to the `consume_user` function
    println!("user = {:?}", user); // error occurs here (trying to access moved variable)
}

fn consume_user(user: User) {
    println!("user = {:?}", user);
}
```
Output
```text
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `user`
 --> examples/tests.rs:7:29
  |
6 |     consume_user(user); // user moved to the `consume_user` function
  |                  ---- value moved here
7 |     println!("user = {:?}", user); // error occurs here (trying to access moved variable)
  |                             ^^^^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `user` has type `User`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
```

---

# Copy trait
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct User(u32);

fn main() {
    let user = User(46);
    consume_user(user); // No move. Instead we're passing copy of the user
    println!("user = {:?}", user);
}

fn consume_user(user: User) {
    println!("user = {:?}", user);
}
```

---

# There is only one reference pointer to the data at a time
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut age = 18;
    let foo = &mut age;
    let boo = &mut age; // error - cannot borrow `age` as mutable more than once at a time
}
```

---

# Borrowing
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User(u32);

fn main() {
    let user = User(46);
    consume_user(&user); // passing reference of the user (reference borrowing)
    println!("user = {:?}", user);
}

fn consume_user(user: &User) {
    println!("user = {:?}", user);
}
```

---

# Lifetime
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut foo: &u32;
    {
        let boo = 40_u32;
        foo = &boo; // borrowing reference, but `foo` goes out of scope
    }
    println!("foo = {:?}", foo);
}
```
Output
```text
error: `boo` does not live long enough
  --> examples/tests.rs:11:5
   |
10 |         foo = &boo;
   |                --- borrow occurs here
11 |     }
   |     ^ `boo` dropped here while still borrowed
12 |     println!("foo = {:?}", foo);
13 | }
   | - borrowed value needs to live until here
```

---

# Memory management
Rust has fine-grained memory management. <br/>
And because of borrowing and ownership, it becomes automatically managed.

# The heap allocated variables.
**NOTE:** We're using experimental features here
```rust
#![feature(box_syntax)]

struct User {
    age: u32
}

fn main() {
    let user = box User { age: 35 };
} // user goes out of scope
```

---

# Reference counting for shared memory
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    age: u32
}

fn main() {
    let user = Rc::new(User { age: 26 }); // ref count 1
    {
        let user_clone = user.clone(); // ref count 2
        consume_user(user_clone);
    } // ref count 1
    consume_user(user.clone()); // move
} // ref count 0

fn consume_user(user: Rc<User>) {
    println!("user = {:?}", user);
}
```

---

# Avoiding iterator invalidation
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    age: u32
}

fn main() {
    let mut user_vec = Vec::new();
    {
        let immut_borrow_user = &user_vec;
        user_vec.push(User { age: 18 }); // error
    }
    user_vec.push(User { age: 35 }); // ok here
}
```
Output
```text
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `user_vec` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> examples/tests.rs:10:9
   |
9  |         let immut_borrow_user = &user_vec;
   |                                  -------- immutable borrow occurs here
10 |         user_vec.push(User { age: 18 });
   |         ^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
11 |     }
   |     - immutable borrow ends here
```

---

# Concurrency
Mutable state is not bad. <br/>
Shared immutable state is not bad. <br/>
Shared mutable state is bad. <br/>
Ownership and borrowing _by default_ prevents data races.

---

# No shared data, no mutable state
```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        println!("Hello, World!");
    });
}
```

---

# Shared mutable state
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    age: u32
}

fn main() {
    let mut user = vec![];
    std::thread::spawn(|| {
        user.push(User { age: 45 })
    });
}
```
Output
```text
closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `user`, which is owned by the current function
```

---

# `move` keyword moves the closure environment
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    age: u32
}

fn main() {
    let mut user = vec![];
    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        user.push(User { age: 45 })
    });
    user.push(User { age: 17 }) // COMPILE error - use of moved value: `user`
}
```

---

# Threads can communicate through channels
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    age: u32
}

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel();
    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        tx.send(produce_user())
    });
    let recv_user: Result<User, _> = rx.recv();
    println!("recv_user = {:?}", recv_user.ok().unwrap());
}

fn produce_user() -> User {
    User { age: 15 }
}
```

---

# Shared state with `Arc` - Atomic Reference Counter
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    age: u32
}

fn main() {
    let user = std::sync::Arc::new(produce_user());
    let user_c = user.clone();
    for i in 1..10 {
        let user_c = user.clone();
        std::thread::spawn(move || {
            println!("user_c = {:?}", user_c)
        });
    }
}

fn produce_user() -> User {
    User { age: 15 }
}
```

---

# Testing
There is built in testing framework
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
struct User {
    age: u8
}

impl User {
    fn new(age: u8) -> Self {
        User {
            age: age
        }
    }

    fn get_age(&self) -> u8 {
        self.age
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {

    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn user_age() {
        let user = User::new(35);
        assert_eq!(35, user.get_age());
    }

    #[test]
    #[ignore]
    fn expensive_test() {
        // Code that takes an hour to run...
    }

    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected = "assertion failed")]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!("Hello", "world");
    }
}
```

---

# Conditional compilation
The attribute `cfg` allows to compile code based on passed flags
```rust
#[cfg(any(unix, windows))]

#[cfg(all(unix, target_pointer_width = "32"))]

#[cfg(not(foo))]

#[cfg(any(not(unix), all(target_os="macos", target_arch = "powerpc")))]
```

Even custom attributes predefined in `.toml` file
```toml
[features]
default = []

foo = []
```
or from CLI
```bash
--cfg feature="${feature_name}"
```

And use them from code
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "foo")]
mod foo {
}
```

---

# Documentation
To generate rust doc simply execute command
```bash
cargo doc
```

rustdoc supports `Markdown`
```rust
/// Constructs a new `Rc<T>`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::rc::Rc;
///
/// let five = Rc::new(5);
/// ```
pub fn new(value: T) -> Rc<T> {
    // Implementation goes here.
}
```

### Summary
**Pros**
* Amazing community.
* Very fast.
* Concurrent.
* Functional.
* Makes system lvl programming fun.
* Easy embedding into other languages.

---

**Cons**
* There is no such libraries which are passed their proof of concept for a long run.
* The existing libraries in most cases have no stable / immutable API yet.
Cargo as well as Rust lang itself using [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) principle
* The language itself is not newbie friendly, and it takes decent learning course.
* No real books, only documentation and article pages.
Although the docs are amazing (also there is milestone to publish first rust book).
* Horrendous compile time (but incremental compilation coming).

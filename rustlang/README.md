### Rust
Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency.
It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

* Rust supports functional and imperative-procedural paradigms.
* Rust used to develop [servo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_(layout_engine)) browser.
* Rust won first place for "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2016 and 2017.
* Benchmarks at [Benchmarksgame](https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=rust&lang2=gpp)
* [Who uses rust.](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/friends.html)

## Why rust is so amazing

### Simple Installation
Go to [https://www.rustup.rs](https://www.rustup.rs)
which suggests to copy and paste `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh` to your terminal.

### The rustup toolchain
The rustup brings:
* The rust programming language itself such as standard library etc...
* `rustc` - The rust-lang compiler.
* `rustup` - The CLI tool which helps to change language distribution channels like `stable`, `beta`, `nightly` and not only.
* `rustdoc` - The rust documentation generator.
* `cargo` - The [cargo](https://crates.io/) package manager.
* Testing, debugging tools and such.

### Cargo package manager
[crates.io](https://crates.io/) the Rust communityâ€™s crate host.
* Unified tool and central repository for entire rust community.
* Easy to use and very intuitive CLI commands.
* Build, execute, test, benchmark and publish bin or lib projects.

### Documentation
The rust documentation is really differs from your know language documentations:
* Markdown support.
* Compile time checks.
* Unified host for all open source libs documentations.
* Examples are everywhere.
* to be continued...

### Language semantics
* Borrow checker.
* Life times.
* Zero cost abstractions.
* to be continued...

### Concurrency
* ARC
* to be continued...

### Summary
**Pros**
* Amazing community.
* Very fast.
* Concurrent.
* Functional.
* Makes system lvl programming fun.
* to be continued...

**Cons**
* There is no such libraries which are passed their proof of concept for a long run.
* The existing libraries no have stable / immutable API yet.
* The language itself is not newbie friendly, and it takes decent learning course.
* No real books, only documentation and article pages (although the docs are amazing).
* to be continued...

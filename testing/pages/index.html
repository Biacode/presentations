    # Preface
    Sometimes new comers have some problems to understand essence of software testing.
    * Most of time they have no idea about how to get started.
    * Some don't know what benefits software testing gives them.
    * They need some really basic newbie guide to get started.
    * Some of them even think that the testing of **their own** application is not their business, because it's QA job.

    ---

    # Real world example
    Imagine situation when you need to investigate some library to deal with date and time. <br/>
    And you found that the [JodaTime](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) is the best solution for you.

    ---

    Let's say that you don't have existing project and starting from scratch.
    1. You'll open your favorite IDE (in my case it is IntelliJ)
    2. Create a new maven or gradle project (I will use gradle)
    3. Add joda-time dependency
    4. And the very first thing that you may want to do is writing a main method to test your new library while reading documentation etc...

    ---

    Let's say we're implementing user access token `AccessToken` which has expiration date. <br/>
    Suppose we have business requirements that we should restrict access if the access token is expired. <br/>
    We can write an `AccessTokenService` which will be responsible for checking if the given access token is expired or not. <br/>
    If we dive in to joda-time docs, we can find method called `isBeforeNow` which is exactly what we need. <br/>
    So after writing our first business logic we have following filling.

    ---

    * Is the joda-time lib. working correctly? (naive guy :D)
    * Do I get it right? For beginners (and not only) the date operations are hard to understand.

    ---

    You will write some code in your `main` method to test it out. <br/>
    Find working example in `MainApplication` <br/>
    If we run the application we will notice that the access token is not expired.

    ---

    So everything goes as expected. <br/>
    Now if we want to push our code to production of course we don't want to have our main method there <br/>
    But we also want to have it somewhere, so in future if we need experiment more with this `unit` of logic we will write it again.

    ---

    Here where the test package comes in. <br/>
    Any code written in this package will be excluded from production build.

    ---

    So let's create a new class called `AccessTokenServiceImplTest` in the test package.

    It would be nice if we can have some library/framework which will execute our `unit test`. <br/>
    We will use [junit](http://junit.org/junit4/faq.html#overview_1) for this purpose.

    ---

    # Short about junit.
    JUnit is a simple, open source framework to write and run repeatable tests.
    > * Assertions for testing expected results
    > * Test fixtures for sharing common test data
    > * Test runners for running tests
    > * JUnit was originally written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck.

    ---

    Now when we have some knowledge about junit framework let's write our first test.

    We can **and should** cover at lest three cases. <br/>
    One case is when the access token is null (invalid arguments). <br/>
    Next case is when access token is not expired. <br/>
    And another one as you may already guess is the case when access token is expired.

    ---

    # TDD - Test Driven Development
    So what is TDD?

    ---

    In short, TDD is when your production code is driven by **test first** approach.

    ---

    # TDD has 3 life cycles
    * First we write failing test
    * Then we write code which _somehow_ makes our failing test green.
    * Then we make some refactoring.
    * Continue cycle.

    ---

    # The benefits of this approach are
    * We will not have any non covered code.
    * Because of our laziness we will write our system components as simple as possible.
    * We will make our components decoupled and test them separately.

    The list above is just small list of benefits which gives you TDD.

    ---

    # Real world example using TDD principles
    Suppose we need a new method which returns the remaining days before our token will be expired. <br/>
    Let's call it `remainingDays`. <br/>
    If we follow the TDD principles we will write failing test first. <br/>
    We even have not written the `remainingDays` method in `AccessTokenService`

    ---

    First we would cover the case when the given access token is null. <br/>
    Then we will check if the access token is expired and throw an `AccessTokenExpiredRuntimeException`. <br/>
    Then we will cover the case when the access token is not expired, and the remaining days are `6`.

    Please see `AccessTokenServiceImplTest` for more details.

    ---

    # Mocking
    Now lets suppose we have to retrieve our access token from some kind of Database. <br/>
    In case if we have relational database such as MySQL, we should have JDBC and/or Hibernate to work with our DB. <br/>
    It means we will make lots of work just for testing our small application unit. <br/>
    Here where we need some framework, which will _Mock_ all implementation details, and return us exactly what we need.

    For this purpose we will use [easymock](http://easymock.org/).

    ---

    # Real world example using mocking principles
    So as before, we need some test to begin.

    ---

    Let's say we should retrieve our access token from the database by given token. <br/>
    For this we can write some method called `getByToken` which will accept the `token` and return `AccessToken` from the database. <br/>
    In terms of good architecture we will separate our DB lookup logic from service. <br/>
    For this purpose let's create `AccessTokenRepository` interface with `findByToken` method.

    ---

    # We will cover following.
    * We're assuming that the token should not be null.
    * In terms of best practices, if our _repository_ can not find access token for given token,
    then our service method should not return null, instead it should throw an exception. <br/>
    **TIP:** _I personally prefer new Java 8 `Optional` to avoid nulls. But this is different story :)_
    * If the access token is found, then we will return it.

    Find future implementation in `AccessTokenServiceImplTest`

    ---

    # Conclusion
    * Testing is not as hard as you think in the beginning. It's just normal flow as you're doing in your regular coding time.
    * TDD - Test Driven Development is really the way to go, it gives you lot of advantages.
    * Mocking helps you to abstract from particular technology / framework stack, instead you're just testing your business units.

## Preface
Some times new comers have some problems to understand essence of software testing.
* Most of time they have no idea about how to get started.
* Some don't know what benefits software testing gives them.
* They need some really basic newbie guide to get started.
* Some of them event think that the testing of **their own** application is not their business, because it's QA job.
